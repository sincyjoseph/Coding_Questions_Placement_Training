Chusky and the Night Game
=========================
Every Friday night Chusky and his friends meet to play billiards at his house. At the beginning of the game a pyramid is formed with the balls: 1 ball in the first level, 2 in the second level, 3 in the third level and so on. Then, a set of balls is assigned for each player and he/she must put only those that were assigned, the one who manages to put them all first, wins.

Chusky is a good host and wants his friends to have fun playing, he knows that the game would be very boring if the number of balls is less than 10 and it would be unfair if any of the players have more or less balls to poke. Since Chusky has $ n $ friends, help him determine the minimum number of balls he will need to make the game fun and fair.
