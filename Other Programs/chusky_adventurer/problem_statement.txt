Chusky the Adventurer
========================

Chusky Jones is a famous adventurer who is looking for the treasures of the Yuraq, an ancient nation that developed in the South American Andes. The Yuraq were famous for protecting their treasures in very complex systems that sought to confuse intruders, this society far ahead of its time dominated mathematics at a high level so that the protection of its treasures was commonly related to combinatorial counting problems, Modular arithmetic and other subjects that his priests considered obscure.
Analyzing ancient texts Chusky determined that the Yuraq used to have multiple paths for their treasures but that many of them were full of deadly traps, because Chusky plans to use robots to search for the treasures for him. The Yuraq maps are represented by an integer  n  that indicates that you must go up  n  times and go down another  n  to reach the treasures, note that at no time is it possible to go down more times than has been uploaded.

For example, if the map is represented by n = 3 , there are 5 different possible mountain roads that can be followed to find the treasure

Chusky will use a robot for every possible existing path, help him determine the total number he will need.

Input
======
The entry will begin with an integer  t (1 <= t <= 1000000) on a line indicating the number of maps that Chusky has. Then follow  t lines, each describing the map for the integer  n (1 <= n <= 1000000).

Output
======

Para cada mapa escribe una línea con el número total de robots que Chusky necesitará. Como este número puedes ser muy grande indique la respuesta módulo 1000000007.
