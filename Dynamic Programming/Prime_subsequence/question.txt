Given a sequence of prime numbers A1,A2,…,AN. This sequence has exactly 2N subsequences.
A subsequence of A is good if it does not contain any two identical numbers; in particular, the empty sequence is good.

You to find the number of good subsequences which contain at most K numbers.
This number could be very large, so compute it modulo 1,000,000,007.

Constraints:
1≤K≤N≤105
2≤Ai≤8,000 for each valid i
