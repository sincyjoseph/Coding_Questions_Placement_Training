You are given a positive integer n.

Let S(x) be sum of digits in base 10 representation of x, for example, S(123)=1 + 2 + 3 = 6, S(0) = 0.

Your task is to find two integers a,b, such that 0 ≤ a,b ≤n, a + b = n and S(a) + S(b) is the largest possible among all such pairs.

Input
The only line of input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1012).

Output
Print largest S(a) + S(b) among all pairs of integers a, b , such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n.
