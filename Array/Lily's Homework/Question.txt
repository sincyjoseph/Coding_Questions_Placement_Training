Consider an array of  distinct integers, arr = [a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]]. George can swap any two elements of the array any number of times. An array is beautiful if the sum of |arr[i] - arr[i-1]|among 0< i < n is minimal.

Given the array , determine and return the minimum number of swaps that should be performed in order to make the array beautiful.

For example, arr = [7, 15, 12, 3]. One minimal array is [3, 7, 12, 15]. To get there, George performed the following swaps:

Swap      Result
      [7, 15, 12, 3]
3 7   [3, 15, 12, 7]
7 15  [3, 7, 12, 15]
It took 2 swaps to make the array beautiful. This is minimal among the choice of beautiful arrays possible.
