Mislove had an array a1, a2, â‹¯, an of n positive integers, but he has lost it. He only remembers the following facts about it:

1)The number of different numbers in the array is not less than l and is not greater than r.
2)For each array's element ai either ai=1 or ai is even and there is a number ai/2 in the array.

For example, if n=5, l=2, r=3 then an array could be [1,2,2,4,4] or [1,1,1,1,2]; but it couldn't be [1,2,2,4,8] because this array contains 4 different numbers; it couldn't be [1,2,2,3,3] because 3 is odd and isn't equal to 1; and it couldn't be [1,1,2,2,16] because there is a number 16 in the array but there isn't a number 16/2=8.

According to these facts, he is asking you to count the minimal and the maximal possible sums of all elements in an array.
