A prime number is a positive number, which is divisible by exactly two different integers.
In this problem your job is to print all primes smaller than or equal to a certain integer n (0 < n < 10000000).

Input
First line of the input file contains a single integer C (0 < C â‰¤ 500000) that indicates the total number
of inputs. Each of the next C lines contains one integer n (0 < n < 10000000).

Output
For each line of input except the first line produce one line of output containing all the primes smaller than or equal to n.

Sample Input
3
10
20
30

Sample Output
2 3 5 7 
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29
