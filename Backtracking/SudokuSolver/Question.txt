Given a partially filled NxN 2D array, the goal is to assign digits (from 1 to 9) 
to the empty cells (cells assigned O value) so that every row, column,and subgrid 
of size 3Ã—3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9. We provide the 
value of N and a partially filled sudoku as input.

Sample Input: 
4
3 4 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 4 3

Sample Output:
==============
3 4 1 0 
0 2 0 0 
0 0 2 0 
0 1 4 3 
==============
3 4 1 2 
1 2 3 4 
4 3 2 1 
2 1 4 3
