Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The most ideal solution to this problem has 2^n-1 steps, where, n = number of disks.

For example: 
For 2 disks :
Let rod 1 = 'A', rod 2 = 'B', rod 3 = 'C'.
Number of Steps = 2^2-1 = 3.

Therefore, 
Step 1 : Shift first disk from 'A' to 'B'.
Step 2 : Shift second disk from 'A' to 'C'.
Step 3 : Shift first disk from 'B' to 'C'.
