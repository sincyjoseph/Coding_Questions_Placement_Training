Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture says that if you take any number and follow the following steps, you will never be stuck in a loop.

If the number is even -> number = number/2;
If the number is odd -> number = 3*number + 1;

If you continue to do this, at some point your number will be equal to 1.

Example: number = 26
	1 Step - number = 26/2 = 13
	2 Step - number = 13*3 + 1 = 40
	3 Step - number = 40/2 = 20
	4 Step - number = 20/2 = 10
	5 Step - number = 10/2 = 5
	6 Step - number = 3*5 + 1 = 16
	7 Step - number = 16/2 = 8
	8 Step - number = 8/2 = 4
	9 Step - number = 4/2 = 2
	10 Step - number = 2/2 = 1

For the number 26, 10 steps are needed, create a solution that calculates the number of steps for a given N number,
and the biggest value the number had during the steps.
