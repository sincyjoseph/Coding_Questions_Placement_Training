We are to input a string of characters(say, s1= XxxyXxxXXxY) and a character(say, X) that belongs to that string
( The string represents the collection of toys and the character represents the most beautiful toy)
 we are to input a number that denotes the no. of beautiful toys needed ( smaller than equal to the maximum beautiful toys, say 2 )
	now we are to print the smallet length (as in no. of characters) of the substring
eg here 2 X containing substrigs are... XxxyX  XxxX XX 
       					 5	4    2
					 max         min therefor 2 printed. \(>o<)/
