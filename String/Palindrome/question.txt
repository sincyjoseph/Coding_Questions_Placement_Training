A palindromic number (or a numeric palindrome) is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
Like 16461, for example, it is "symmetrical".

This program reverses an integer (entered by the user) using while loop. 
Then, if statement is used to check whether the reversed number is equal to the original number or not.
